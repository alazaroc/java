# Webclient
Example of use of spring WebClient to implement a request.

Spring WebFlux includes a reactive, non-blocking WebClient for HTTP requests. The client has a functional, fluent API with reactive types for declarative composition, see Reactive Libraries. WebFlux client and server rely on the same non-blocking codecs to encode and decode request and response content.
