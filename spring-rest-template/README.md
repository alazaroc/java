# Rest Template
RestTemplate is a synchronous client to perform HTTP requests. It is the original Spring REST client and exposes a simple, template-method API over underlying HTTP client libraries.

As of 5.0 the RestTemplate is in maintenance mode, with only minor requests for changes and bugs to be accepted going forward. Please, consider using the WebClient which offers a more modern API and supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios.
